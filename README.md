# Bug Tracking System

## Project Overview
This Java project utilizes Swing for the GUI and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Several design patterns and principles were implemented to ensure code quality and maintainability.

### Design Patterns Used
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Facade Pattern**: Used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### Design Principles Followed
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has only one responsibility, i.e., one reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
